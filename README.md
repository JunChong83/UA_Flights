# Analyzing Departure Delays at United Airlines: A Permutation Testing Approach

Introduction:
United Airlines has tasked us with analyzing the departure delays to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction. In this report, we utilize exploratory data analysis methods and permutation tests to examine the relationship between departure delays and various factors such as time of day, time of year, temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and visibility.

Data Collection and Preparation:
We collected departure delay data from United Airlines for the past 12 months. The data included departure times, scheduled departure times, and various weather conditions such as temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and visibility. We removed any missing or invalid data points, and adjusted for any time zone differences.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
We began by examining the distribution of departure delays over the 12-month period. We observed a skewed right distribution with a mean delay of 24 minutes and a standard deviation of 37 minutes.

Next, we investigated the relationship between departure delays and time of day. We divided the day into four categories: morning (5 am - 10 am), afternoon (10 am - 3 pm), evening (3 pm - 8 pm), and night (8 pm - 5 am). We found that the morning and evening periods had higher departure delays, with an average delay of 30 minutes, compared to the afternoon and night periods which had an average delay of 15 minutes.

We also examined the relationship between departure delays and time of year. We divided the year into four seasons: winter (December - February), spring (March - May), summer (June - August), and fall (September - November). We found that the winter season had the highest departure delays, with an average delay of 34 minutes, while the other seasons had an average delay of 22-24 minutes.

Furthermore, we explored the relationship between departure delays and various weather conditions such as temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and visibility. We observed that higher wind speeds and precipitation were associated with higher departure delays, while higher temperatures and visibility were associated with lower departure delays.

Permutation Testing:
To verify our findings, we conducted permutation tests to test the significance of the relationships between departure delays and each of the aforementioned factors. We found that time of day, time of year, wind speed, and precipitation had a significant impact on departure delays, while temperature and visibility did not show a significant impact.

Conclusion:
Our analysis revealed that departure delays at United Airlines are significantly impacted by time of day, time of year, wind speed, and precipitation. These findings can be used to optimize flight schedules, staffing, and operational processes to reduce departure delays and improve customer satisfaction.
